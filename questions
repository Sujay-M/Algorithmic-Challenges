Problem Statement

Given N integers, count the number of pairs of integers whose difference is K.

Input Format 
The 1st line contains N & K (integers). 
The 2nd line contains N numbers of the set. All the N numbers are distinct.

Output Format 
An integer that tells the number of pairs of integers whose difference is K.

Constraints: 
N <= 105 
0 < K < 109 
Each integer will be greater than 0 and at least K smaller than 231-1

Simple encryption. String(no spaces) is taken as input(max length 81). It is put in form of a matrix and output will be the string that we get when we traverse the matrix along the column and is separated by space after the end of each column.
constraint on #rows and #columns
floor(sqrt(lengthofstring))≤rows≤column≤ceil(sqrt(lengthofstring))
